# ExploreHub (Tour and Travel Website)
It is a college project, where I collaborated with my two other classmates to build this project.
We have created a tour and travel website, where users can search for different places to visit in India and book a trip.
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, PHP, Ajax, phpMyAdmin, and XAMPP server.
It is a responsive website, that can adjust on different devices.
We have added two forms one is a booking form, and the other is a feedback form.
Users can sign up, log in, change passwords, add favorite places in their dashboard, book trips, and logout.
When the user signs up, books a trip, and gives feedback mail is sent to them via PHPMailer.
